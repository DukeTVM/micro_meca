# micro_meca
Micromechanical model which describe the pullout process under combined cracking mode integrating the distribution of fiber orientation\\
-The single fiber pullout process is described in the 1st block after the materials properties.\\
-The probability distribution function of fiber orientation is marked in the 2nd block.\\
-The stress transferred might be computed by the formulas in the 3rd block.\\
Both hooked-end and straight fiber are presented in this code and might be computed separately.
